# UNDP_Accelerator_Lab


In 2019, [UNDP's Accelerator Labs](https://www.undp.org/acceleratorlabs) were built to learn what works and what doesn't in sustainable development to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in time.

One of the three team members of the Accelerator Labs, the solution mapper, has discovered 359 grassroots energy solutions from different regions, demographics, 
and energy sources in the world. These solutions are promising for UNDP's Strategic Plan (2022 â€“ 2025), which sets out the ambitious objective to increase access to clean and affordable energy for 500 million people by speeding up investment in distributed renewable energy solutions, especially for those most challenging to reach and in a crisis context.  

The objective of this volunteer project (a project of [Viz for Social Good](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/our-mission)) was to build an interactive dashboard and infographic for the government partners, 
international donor community, and the general public to advocate for local solutions in achieving SDGs.
